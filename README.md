## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <a name="executivesum"></a>
This report proposes a social insurance program designed to relieve the economic costs associated with climate-related catastrophes in Storslysia. The primary objective of the program is to mitigate the financial consequences for residents residing in high-risk areas facing displacement. The program covers costs arising from climate-related hazards such as temporary housing and household contents, but further assists Storslysia manage displacement risk through a buyback scheme aimedtowards high-risk, low value properties. By implementing the program, the program will reduce economic costs associated with climate catastrophe-related events by approximately 16.58% in the short-term and 28.75% in the long-term. Furthermore, the proposed social insurance program will continue to lower costs even if the climate situation deteriorates as represented by Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP)scenarios. Hence, with 95% confidence, the program costs do not exceed 10% of Storslysia’s 
annual GDP in all four SSP scenarios. However, risks such as increasingly correlated hazard events pose threats to the program meaning ongoing monitoring is recommended.

## SECTION 1: PROGRAM SYNOPSIS <a name="synopsis"></a>

### 1.1 OBJECTIVES <a name="objectives"></a>
The proposed social insurance program is designed to provide citizens with financial protection and support from climate-related events. The program aims to reduce the costs associated with displacement and support the overall resilience of affected communities and individuals. More detailed outlines of the objectives are as below:

**1. Mitigating Displacement Risk**

The program will reduce displacement risk by incentivising proactive relocation, offering abuyback scheme to houses of low-income policyholders living in high-risk regions, enabling them to relocate before or after a severe or catastrophic climate-related event. This helps reduce costs associated with emergency displacement, improving the overall effectiveness of the program.

**2.Financial Protection for Policyholders**

The program provides policyholders with financial protection against the costs associated with voluntary, proactive relocation as well as involuntary displacement following a catastrophic event. 

**3. Financial Sustainability for Storslysia**

The program is constructed to be financially sustainable over the long-term by establishing appropriate premium levels, deductibles, and coverage limits that align with the expected costs of claims and ensure solvency.

**4. Alleviating Climate Risk Pressure**

The program is designed to relieve financial pressures of voluntary and involuntary relocation of citizens affected by catastrophic climate-related events, reducing economic and psychological burdens to Storslysia’s population

### 1.2 PROGRAM METRICS <a name="programmetrics"></a>
This program will be assessed using the following five metrics: 

  ***1. Policyholder uptake:*** The number of policyholders who have enrolled in the program, broken down by geographic region and demographics such as property value.

  ***2. Claims frequency and severity:*** The number and cost of claims made by policyholders under the program, broken down by voluntary and involuntary relocation. 

  ***3. Relocation rates:*** The number and percentage of policyholders who have relocated proactively, broken down by geographic region and demographics. 

  ***4. Customer satisfaction:*** Feedback from policyholders on their satisfaction with the program, 
including its coverage and customer service. 

  ***5. Financial sustainability:*** The program's financial performance, including premiums with relocation exceed 10% of Storslysia’s GDP annually.

To track initial program uptake and document claims experience, these metrics may be reported on a monthly or quarterly basis. In the long-term, these metrics may be reported on an annual or biennial basis to evaluate the program's ongoing success in meeting its objectives.
